## Why the development towards becoming a programmer and not a job related to my field of studies?
While studying and working out various projects for my classes and for myself - in my spare time, I noticed that solving various problems, searching for new knowledge and implementing it to my own needs is very interesting and engaging for me. When starting any project, I feel motivated and absorbed for hours on end. Even when problems require a lot of work to be solved, I strive hard to finally find a solution.

In no other activity have I found such a strong motivation as in learning programming.
